## Project Description


As a Zero Robotics Research Intern at MIT's Space Enabled Media Lab, I played a vital role in optimizing PID controller parameters for the MIT Astrobee robot simulator and automating data collection and analysis for the Zero Robotics project using Python scripts. In collaboration with a small team of six, which included NASA astronauts, I contributed to hosting the Zero Robotics 2022 technical competition, where students engage in STEM by designing and coding algorithms for small robots known as Astrobees. This unique program allows participants to test their algorithms aboard the Astrobees robots aboard the International Space Station, providing hands-on experience in solving real-world challenges in a space environment. Throughout this internship, I honed skills in Controls Engineering, Data Automation, and Simulation Test and Calibration.

## Main Software Used

1. **GoogleDrive API: Automating Data Collection**
   - Utilized GoogleDrive API to automate data collection, enhancing efficiency.

2. **Android Studio: Testing and Tuning PID controller and Code**
   - Used Android Studio for testing code on NASA's internal simulation software and tuning MIT's external simulation software.

3. **HTML: Website Editing and Feature Enhancement**
   - Applied HTML for website editing and added features to improve the participant experience.
