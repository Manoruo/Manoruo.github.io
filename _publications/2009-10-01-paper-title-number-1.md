The paper introduces a two-player game-based reinforcement learning (RL) environment designed for cyber defense exercises. It leverages recent advancements in cyber battle simulation platforms to train RL-based autonomous agents, enhancing both attacker and defender performance, with accelerated convergence achieved through guidance from expert knowledge extracted from Cybersecurity Knowledge Graphs on attack and mitigation steps. The proposed approach has been implemented and integrated into the CyberBattleSim system.
