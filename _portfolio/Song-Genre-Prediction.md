##  <ins> Project Description </ins>

1. Trained Machine Learning Model
Trained LSTM and CNN machine learning model using a dataset containing song lyrics and associated genres. 
2. Multi-Label and Multi-Class Models
Created both multi-label models to predict several genres for a song and multi-class models to predict a single genre for each song.
3. Dataset Curation Algorithm
Implemented an algorithm to curate the dataset by querying LastFM for songs and their respective genres. The Genius Lyrics API was utilized to retrieve lyrics for each song.
4. Integration with Kaggle Dataset
Integrated a Kaggle dataset containing songs and associated genres, combining it with LastFM data to enrich genre information for specific songs.
