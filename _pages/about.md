![Illistration of AI + Autonomous Systems](/images/AI_Autonomous_Systems.png){: .align-right width="300px"}

I am a highly motivated scholar who recently graduated from the University of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC), where I studied Computer Science with a focus on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML). 

I enjoy working on diverse projects incorporating artificial intelligence to solve challenging problems, and I am most interested in applying AI/ML to create robust autonomous vehicles. 

I have had many incredible research opportunities working on various robotics and machine learning projects at organizations such as MIT, the University of Pennsylvania, Apple, and UMBC. 

I aspire to earn a Ph.D. and continue my studies in AI/ML, learning more about how we can utilize this to create more dynamic autonomous systems capable of working more seamlessly and safely with people ðŸ’¡

Welcome!

Welcome to my personal website. Here you can find various information about my interest, skills, work experiences, and some of the personal projects I work on in my spare time. I am currently waiting to hear back from various Ph.D. programs for next fall and am looking for internship opportunities for Spring/Summer 2024. 

*Please feel free to reach out if there are any opportunities you believe I would be a good fit for!*
